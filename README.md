### Some history
"Game of life" is a cellular automaton, invented by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970.

### Rules
If the cell has not been painted over yet and it has exactly 3 painted neighbors, then we also paint over it. But if the cell is already painted over and it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains painted over.

Such rules are called: **B3 / S23**
